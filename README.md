# CIFAR-10 Object Recognition Using ResNet50

This repository demonstrates how to use a ResNet50 model to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project covers dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, and inference using PyTorch or TensorFlow.

---

## üìå Overview

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network with 50 layers, is used in this project for image classification. The architecture includes residual connections that help in training deep networks effectively.

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of ResNet50 for CIFAR-10 classification
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Checkpoints for saving models
- Visualization of training results

## üîé About ResNet50

ResNet50 is a 50-layer deep convolutional neural network introduced in the groundbreaking paper *"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"* by Kaiming He et al. (2015). It solves the problem of vanishing gradients in deep neural networks by introducing **residual connections**, allowing the model to learn identity mappings.

**Key Components of ResNet50:**
1. **Residual Blocks**: Skip connections bypass some layers, which helps the network learn efficiently by directly propagating gradients during backpropagation.
2. **Bottleneck Layers**: ResNet50 uses a bottleneck structure to reduce the computational complexity while maintaining high representational power.
3. **Deep Architecture**: It contains 50 layers, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, making it suitable for complex image recognition tasks.

**Advantages:**
- Efficient training for very deep networks.
- High accuracy on image classification benchmarks such as ImageNet.
- Reusability in transfer learning for various datasets, including CIFAR-10.
